# DSA

## Memory Allocation

   ### Static Allocation
    
   - The memory allocated all at the compile time.
   - Static allocation is in stack memory.
   - For example : Array

   ### Dynamic Allocation

   - Dynamic : the memory allocated at the run time (execution time).
   - Dynamic allocation is in Heap memory.
   - For example : Vector


## Time Complexity
 <i>
   - Its not the actual time taken but amount of time taken as function of input size (n) . It is denoted Big 'O' i.e O(n).
   </i>
   
   - 'O' is known as worst case scenario and also upper bound in DSA .


## Space Complexity  

<i>
  - Amount of space taken by an algorithm as  function of input size(n). It is also denoted by big 'O'.
