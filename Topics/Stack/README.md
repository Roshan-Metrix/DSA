# Stack 
-> It follows LIFO (Last In First Out) order. It is a linear data structure that serves as a collection of elements, with :

### Two main principal operations:

1. **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop**: Removes the element from the top of the stack.

### Other operations include:

3. **Peek/Top**: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
4. **isEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.
5. **Size**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.

### Stacks are commonly used in various applications such as:

- **Function Call Management**: The call stack in programming languages uses a stack to manage function calls and returns.
- **Expression Evaluation**: Stacks are used to evaluate expressions and convert infix expressions to postfix or prefix notation.
- **Backtracking Algorithms**: Stacks are used in algorithms that require backtracking, such as depth-first search (DFS) in graph traversal.
- **Undo Mechanisms**: Many applications use stacks to implement undo functionality, allowing users to revert to previous states.

Overall, stacks are a fundamental data structure that provides efficient ways to manage and manipulate data in a last-in-first-out manner.
